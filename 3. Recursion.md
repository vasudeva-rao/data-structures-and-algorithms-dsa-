## What is recursion?

Function calling itself until base/termination condition

If no base condition -> Stack overflow error, memory is limited.

## When to use Recursion?

A problem can be divided into smaller sub problems and solving sub-problems helps in solving original problem.

Calling sub-problems which will be closer and closer to the base condition.

## Recursive Leap of Faith

Given n, print n n-1 n-2... 1 1 2 3 .... n-1 n

1. Understand the problem -> print 3 2 1 1 2 3, for n = 3
2. Identify the subproblem -> printing 2 1 1 2
3. Trust / Faith -> Trusting solving subproblem will help in solving original problem, if it works for n, it will work for n-1.
4. Link 1 and 2 -> 3 2 1 1 2 3
5. Base Condition -> for 0, return.

n recursive_call n
function seq(n) {
if n = 0 -> return
print n
seq(n-1)
print n
}

## Recursion uses stack

## Visualization can be done through Recursion Tree and Recuresion Call Stack

## Space complexity -> O(n)

## Recursion vs Iteration

- Factorial can be solved through iteration as well.
- Things done recursively can also be done iteratively.\
  - Then why use recursion?
    Many times solution written using recursion will have better readability and easy to write and comprehend when comes to complex questions.
- Iteration doesn't uses Recursion Call Stack space. (better space complexity).

- Recursion has both ascending phase (calling phase) and descending phase (returning phase).
- Iteration has only has ascending phase (calling phase).
  fact = 1
  for i = 5 to 1
  fact = fact \* i
  return fact
- Once i moves from 5 to 4, at no point we will comeback to 5 again in iteration.
- But in recursion, f(5) -> f(4) -> f(3) -> f(2) -> f(1), once f(1) returns we will go to f(2), then
  f(2) returns, then we go to f(3) and so on.

## Ways to write base condition

Last valid input
First invalid input

For factorial, last valid input is, if n = 1 -> return 1.
For printing n n-1 ... 1, First invalid input if n<1 -> return.

## Recurrence relation

Recurrence relation expresses the solution of a problem as a function of solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
Eg: For finding factorial of a positive integer n, recurrence relation is given by: F(n) = n x F(n-1)
F(n-1) is the sub-problem.

Recurrence relation for printing n n-1...1 1 2 .... n is
print n
F(n-1)
print n

Recurrence relation talks about recursive case, not base case.

## Recursion Tree

Drawing recursion tree for Fibonacci Series.
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
0, 1, sum of previous two terms.

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...

For F(3):
F(3)
F(2) F(1) -> 1
F(1)->1 F(0)->0

## Recursion Approaches

We can write recursive solutions

1. 0 to n
2. n to 0

Eg: Given, n, find 1+2+...+n

1. 0 to n
   function sum(currentSum, n) {
   if currentSum = n, return n
   return currentSum + sum(currentSum + 1, n)
   }

n = 3
sum(0, 3) -> 0 + sum (1, 3) => 0 + 1 + sum (2,3) => 0 + 1 + 2 + sum(3,3) => 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

2. n to 0
   function sum(n) {
   if n = 0, return
   return n + sum(n-1)
   }

## Recursion is everywhere

Its the parent of

- Backtracking
  Guided form of recursion.

- Dynamic Programming
  Top down / memoization is recursive. We will use this to come up with bottom up / Tabulation (iterative).

- Greedy algorithms
  Recursion is where we try to optimize next step (short term not long term).

- Divide and Conquer
  Recursion is used to divide problems into sub-problems and solve each sub-problem independently.

## Complexity analysis of recursive solutions

- Identify the number of nodes in recursive tree and multiply with the work done at each node.
  T = [# of nodes] \* [work done at each node]

- If leaf and other nodes doing separate things
  T = ([# of LN] _ [work done per LN]) + ([# of ON] _ [work done per ON])

Space Complexity:

- Given by depth of recursive call stack/tree.
